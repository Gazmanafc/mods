This is a combination of four pagan texts, you can choose from:

[*]Random Havamal Verse
[*]Random Wiccan Rede Verse
[*]Random Witch's Law Verse
[*]Random Thelema Quotation

Or if you wish to show them all this is also possible.

The mod combines all the files into 1 language file and gives users the option of displaying what verse they would like to display.

This mod is designed for a Pagan Community.
